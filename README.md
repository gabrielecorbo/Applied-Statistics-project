## Description

The aim of this project is to exploit machine learning techniques to create a cross-platform web-app to recommend products based on clients' need.

We have been provided with the dataset `Needs.xls`, which contains information about clients and products.

We followed a multi-tool approach, porting models to exploit each software's development strengths. We used **MATLAB**, **R**, for prototyping and **Python** with **Streamlit** module for deployment.

The prototyping part is in the `dev` folder while the Python part is in the `models` folder; finally the `app.py` file contains the Streamlit implementation.

## Output

The web-app [is available here](https://share.streamlit.io/marcolucchini/fintech-project/main/app.py).

The `presentation.pdf` is in the `output` folder.
